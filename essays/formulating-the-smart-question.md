# StackOverflow
<img class="ui medium right circular floated image" src="../images/stackoverflowlogo.png">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is someone who is an absolute beginner or even an experienced programmer, he has most likely visited---or at least heard of---a  website called [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), a platform for questions and answers related to computer programming. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to find an answer to a question or probably about your code, the first thing you would do is use Google. Google then sends links to you related to your problem; most of the time the top searches will include StackOverflow links where a possible solution to your problem could have already been solved and answered by someone else. But what if no one else has even asked a question remotely close to your problem? Now it is time for you to ask the question yourself, and hopefully get some answers.

# Creating the Smart Question
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can just go ahead and start a thread and ask our question on StackOverflow. But if you are not careful in formulating your question, it can be shut down as quickly as you start it. In StackOverflow, certain user groups can vote to close down your question. Reasons as to why your question was closed could vary from your question being too vague to your question being a duplicate of another thread. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, what if for instance if your question was closed due to being considered a duplicate, that when you do go to the question that's considered the 'original' of your duplicate question, none of the solutions from that thread can be applied to your problem? Chances are, you just need to reword and formulate a new question in a smarter way so that it may be answered with possible solutions that are targeted specifically for your problem. 

### How To Ask Questions The Smart Way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric Steven Raymond wrote a useful and comprehensive essay that establishes guidelines for asking a smart question---[How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).
