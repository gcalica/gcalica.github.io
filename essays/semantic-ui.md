# Frameworks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In development, whether it is for software or web development, frameworks and libraries exist to make things easier for the developer. Developers have taken problems that they encounter on a consistent basis and made tools to help alleviate those problems. These solutions could include something as simple as making programming to be a smoother and faster process syntactically. Or instead of having to implement a complex algorithm by yourself, you could use a library that already has that algorithm implemented and you simply have to call that function in your code.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building UI for a website is no easy feat. Now to add more on top of the plate, building a visually pleasing UI is a much harder feat. When a visitor loads up a web page, there are certain elements on the web page that would immediately pop out more than other elements. Many factors can come into play as to how a certain element can pop out more than others in a web page. Some of these factors would include something as simple as the size or color of the element. Obviously, an element that is big and bright red would pop out more than small, white elements. While something as simple as making one element bigger than the rest is a simple action at face value, in reality there is a bigger psychological game at play. There is an entire set of study when it comes to designing UI/UX interfaces for websites that aims to improve user interaction. So how do we start in making these types of UI as a web developer?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where UI Frameworks can come into play.
